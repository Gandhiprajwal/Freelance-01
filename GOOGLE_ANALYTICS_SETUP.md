- Sign in with your Google account.

## 2. Create a Property (if you don’t have one)
- Click **Admin** (bottom left).
- Under the **Account** column, select your account (or create one).
- Under the **Property** column, click **Create Property**.
- Enter your website name, set the time zone and currency, then click **Next**.
- Fill in business info, click **Create**.

## 3. Set Up a Data Stream
- After creating the property, you’ll be prompted to set up a data stream.
- Choose **Web**.
- Enter your website URL and stream name, then click **Create stream**.

## 4. Copy Your Measurement ID
- After creating the stream, you’ll see a page with your **Measurement ID** (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
- Copy this ID.

## 5. Add to Your Project
- In your `.env` file, add:
  ```env
  VITE_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
  ```
